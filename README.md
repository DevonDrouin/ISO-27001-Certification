# GRC Portfolio - ISO/IEC 27001:2022

This repository showcases hands-on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) work completed as part of the GRC Mastery training and ISO/IEC 27001:2022 badge. It includes real-world simulations such as risk assessments, compliance matrices, policy writing, and control mapping.

The goal is to demonstrate a practical understanding of cybersecurity governance frameworks and how to apply them in an organizational context.

## Conclusion 

- Understanding how ISO/IEC 27001 formalizes risk-based thinking gave me a deeper appreciation of aligning business objectives with security goals.
- GRC is not just about compliance! it's about operational resilience and informed decision-making.
- Writing actual policy documents made me more comfortable communicating security expectations clearly.
