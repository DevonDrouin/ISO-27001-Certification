# GRC Portfolio â€“ ISO/IEC 27001:2022

This repository showcases hands-on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) work completed as part of the GRC Mastery training and ISO/IEC 27001:2022 badge. It includes real-world simulations such as risk assessments, compliance matrices, policy writing, and control mapping.

The goal is to demonstrate a practical understanding of cybersecurity governance frameworks and how to apply them in an organizational context.

## ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Summary

ISO/IEC 27001 is a global standard for information security management systems (ISMS). This frameworkconsolidates controls into 4 themes:
- Organizational
- People
- Physical
- Technological

This repo includes:
- ISMS 
- A sample Statement of Applicability (SoA)
- Risk treatment plan template
- Control mapping for Annex A

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78ad5e2f-6b61-4e67-ba78-de60e47d5b32)



The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were originally deployed, exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls wide open, and all other resources are deployed with public endpoints visible to the Internet; aka, no use for Private Endpoints.

For the "AFTER" metrics, Network Security Groups were hardened by blocking ALL traffic with the exception of my admin workstation, and all other resources were protected by their built-in firewalls as well as Private Endpoint

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2024-12-12 23:18
Stop Time 2024-12-13 23:18

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 6611
| Syslog                   | 15903
| SecurityAlert            | 6
| SecurityIncident         | 324
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed/ AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 2660

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2024-12-18 20:33
Stop Time	2024-12-19 20:33

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 506
| Syslog                   | 0
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 4
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed/ AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

The following Table shows the percentage of the metrics that had changed after the security controls had been applied

| Metric                   | Change after security controls 
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | -92.35%
| Syslog                   | -100.00%
| SecurityAlert            | -100.00%
| SecurityIncident         | -98.77%
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed/ AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | -100.00%

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was constructed in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was employed to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Additionally, metrics were measured in the insecure environment before security controls were applied, and then again after implementing security measures. It is noteworthy that the number of security events and incidents were drastically reduced after the security controls were applied, demonstrating their effectiveness. The only Security events were falsely flagged as they were "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" that had not been excluded in the alert rules. 

It is worth noting that if the resources within the network were heavily utilized by regular users, it is likely that more security events and alerts may have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls.
